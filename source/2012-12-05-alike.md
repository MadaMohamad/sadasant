It was alike to  
see you walking over  
the ice of winter.  

Rememberance of  
vanishing silhouettes  
astonishing, you.  

A poison, it is  
very close to end with  
my very caution.  

Will you perceive  
my bones breaking thru  
colliding tissues.  

The interference  
of no shape of no thought,  
were we arousing.  

And cold slipped back  
when the silence checked in.  
Good morning, morning.
