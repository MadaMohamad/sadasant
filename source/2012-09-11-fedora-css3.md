**UPDATE**

Hello people!

I went to talk to Fedora's community about the Fedora Logo I made with CSS3
and their responses were very kind and cheerful, they wanted to use it
for further purposes but in order to do that, we'd have to fix the
license to make it belong to Red Hat, as this logo is part of the
Fedora Trademarks.

I happily accepted their premises and gave them the rights for this
piece of web craft, so you can find it now in the [fedora-logos
repository](http://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/fedora-logos.git/),
over here:

-   [Test it live](http://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/fedora-logos.git/plain/css3/demo.html).
-   [Browse the Source Code](http://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/fedora-logos.git/tree/css3).

If you want to use it, remember to [read this first](http://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/fedora-logos.git/tree/COPYING),
to comply with the [Fedora Trademark Guidelines](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Legal:Trademark_guidelines).

That's it, thanks for reading!

**Original Post (08, September, 2012):**

Yesterday I upgraded my dekstop's old Fedora 15 to the last Fedora 17.
It is always a fulfilling experience.

I've been using [Fedora Linux](https://fedoraproject.org/) for a while,
I think it's the most reliable free and opensource linux distribution,
despite the honorable work of others, like the incredible Debian community,
or the Ubuntu guys. Fedora is just a very good distro, it has
a perfectly integrated Gnome 3 environment, SELinux, and many other
[awesome features](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/17/FeatureList).

If you have followed me a bit, you might know I'm a
[Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) user too,
both are my favorite distros. Arch encourages you to learn,
but sometimes you're running out of time and you just want
to work, that's when the good Fedora comes in.

Right after installing it, I reminded how some amazing people
managed to realize the [FUDcon LATAM here in Venezuela](http://orvtech.com/general/fotos-fudcon-valencia-minuto-a-minuto/).
I couldn't be there, but I shared their emotion though their
pictures and tweets.

With that in mind, I took part of my friday night
to make Fedora's logo with CSS3, as a gift for the FUDcon people :)
