I recently entered the last summer "vacations" at the university,
not to relax (even though it helped), but to reorganize myself
and to keep building resources for my own development / exposure.

These two months of hedonisms are planned to be distributed in:
contribute more properly with the teams that give me enough
money to call it "work", share more time with my beloved ones
and to fulfill my learning desires, at least a bit, by
reading and coding like crazy.

So I started doing it. But what exactly?

For the last couple of months, my head has been stormy,
thinking on the next trick. I've made some apps, like
**[TheTwittingDead](http://sadasant.com/d/TheTwittingDead/)**,
**[Tuitpix](http://tuitpix.com/)**,
my crazy chat called **[Talk](http://talk.sadasant.com/)**
or the little
**[Asteroids.js](http://sadasant.com/d/asteroids.js/play)**,
but they were all for the entertainment of others,
I thought it was the time to build something a bit more
useful.

From my day-by-day I featured I needed a place where
I could organize my ideas better.
My first look went to mindmaps, I've been having some
interest on integrating myself more with them,
since I've been using them with some teachers and for
family projects, but after a quick search my conclusion
was that all the applications over the net were
not satisfying, not even mobile apps.

You might already guess that I'm a bit picky, indeed,
I wanted something structurally as a mindmap, but built with
the incredible [JSON](http://json.org/),
and browsable, just as _object literals_ within
Webkit's developer's tools or Firebug's console.
Also, my wish was to build it with my own libraries,
such as [Ink.js](https://github.com/sadasant/Ink.js),
in order to polish them and to force me to learn in depth.

With that in mind, I started to point out everything I needed
to build such application, I said I needed gradients, rotations,
bézier curves, more math, physics, maybe a better collide
system, but also I needed to summarize the structure
in a stable schema in order to build all the transitions
and the server API, the logins, the ajaxy stuffs, the
mobile compatibility...
Looking back I think I was overthinking it, as usual.

When I felt it to start getting oversized,
I realized again how sacred is time. The bunch of things
I wanted to learn in two months were going to overflow me,
I think I like hustling, but the lack of sleep was just too much.
I needed to simplify, as well as I owed myself some learning hours
in existing JavaScript libraries.

I wanted to make an application with
[Backbone](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) and
[RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), with
[NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) at the backend
and [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org/) for the database.
I wanted to document at least a bit of the experience
I learned working with the [Geeklist](http://geekli.st/) team,
the UI/UX lessons given by the masters [@csanz](https://twitter.com/csanz)
and [@ChrisStuph](https://twitter.com/ChrisStuph),
and finally, I wanted to make not a game,
but instead something indeed useful for me.

My real immediate goal wasn't
to surf into image graphics, but to get a bit more
sodden within the _JavaScript_, _Node.js_ world,
and also, to build something simple to organize my ideas,
what I really needed was to make a note-taking application.

Even if I didn't know completely how to work with all those
technologies, once I had it right in front of me,
I couldn't stop thinking about it. The days passed as
it was taking from, with no lines of code given,
that weekend arrived, with some bad news, but
with a bit more time, ready to be spent.

I managed to drive myself into backbone and require,
it wasn't too hard, by the end of the weekend I had
some views and models, so I thought and said:
"give me two more days and it will be ready".

But it didn't happen, I got more busy, so I started spending
my nights again, for two more weeks, until the application was
releasable.

That day ended up being August's 11th.

## Topics

**topics** is a web application for creating notes by topic.
It's purpose is to give you a simple, beautiful
and fully interactive environment
where you can inquire about your favorite things,
begin summaries of life events,
take annotations from books,
classes or any other subject.
Access it anywhere with your twitter account,
and share your ideas over social networks!

It's very good for me, I've been taking many notes
and sharing them with my friends. Also, it has markdown,
so you can write  `CØÐE` over there.
