  "about": "I'm 20 years old. I enjoy being an autodidact. I like humanity and science. I believe hatred grows as communications crumble. I love how everything is uncertain. I live in Venezuela, but I enjoy traveling. I work for my own and do IT for fun. I like to dive minds, solitude, partnership and projects.",
  "music": "6 strings have made my day for so long... I like silence, minimalistic/geek/experimental music, jazz and noisy metal. In some way, life is like the only song you're going to listen for all your existence, there's always a way to make it enjoyable.",
  "writes": "Writing scraps has been my hobby since I was almost 10. I like to be a freethinker, to read tech stuff (sometimes novels) and to talk when there's need. I've made small speeches, and I'll make more. I hate to lead but sometimes I have to. I promote tolerance and openess. I make a lot of mistakes, and I love to learn from them.",
  "draws": "A pen (or the brush tool) is my favorite weapon, with it I can break my own logic, my own nature, to explore other states of mind, other perspectives.",
  "foss": "<a href='' title='Hacking, programming'>Coding</a> is wizardry, you can bring life or death to anything, find solutions to even the smallest problems by just writing some lines, share your creations without fear of scarce, it's amazing."
