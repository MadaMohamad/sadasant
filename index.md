* [About me][1]
    I have 20 years old. I enjoing being an autodidact. I like humanity and science. I believe hatred grows as communications crumble. I love how everything is uncertain. I live at Venezuela, but I enjoy traveling. I work for my own and do IT for fun. I like to dive minds, solitude, partnership and projects.

* [Improvisations][2]
    I like silence, minimalist music, jazz and noisy metal. I like to hear the nature more than anything. I like to think life is like if you were going to listen only one song in all your existence, there's always a way to make it enjoyable.

    Records:
    * {Sound Cloud}

* [Writes][3]
    I've loved writing scraps since almost 10. I like to be a freethinker, to read tech stuff (sometimes novels) and to talk when there's need. I've made speeches, and I'll make more. I hate to lead but sometimes I have to. I promote tolerance and oppeness. I make a lot of mistakes, and I love to learn from them.

* [Design][4]
    I've ever loved drawing, it's my favorite weapon, a pen, even if it's ballpoint, digital or just analog, with it I can break my own logic, my own nature, to explore other states of minds, other perspectives.

* [Codes][5]
    I believe programming is magic, you can bring life to anything, or find solutions to even the smallest problems by just writing some lines, it's amazing.
